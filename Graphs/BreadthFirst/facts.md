* Bipartite -- conditions 
* if graph is acyclic then it is bipartite
* if vertices are odd then there is no cycle but it will try to put the same vertices on some different level so you have to check the odd case
* if vertices are even then there is not problem they will asign the vertices on the same level
* Prim's and dikstra
* topological sort
